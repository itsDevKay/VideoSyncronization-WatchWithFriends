# Flask Socket-IO Video Streaming
A simple example of using flask-socket-io to livestream processed video within a flask application (without WebRTC)

I had some trouble getting video streaming and processing to work with Flask on another project, so this repo is here in case anyone else is having the same problems.
I hope this repo is useful!
